### This document explain the reason for using design pattern.

#### In this project, I didn't know what is design pattern until now, writting this document, I can only explain My coding pattern.

#### Every Function's name means its action. Usually, Function name is 'a_b_c' form, 'a' is short word or acting. 'b' is usually object only acting when a is word. 'c' is few, it is a some of identifier for simillar variable or function.

#### Variable's name is also 'a_b_c' form, it is 'a' includes 'b', 'b' includes 'c'. So, it can be 'a_b', 'a_b_c_d'... form.
